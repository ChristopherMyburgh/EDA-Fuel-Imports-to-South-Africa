EDA---Fuel-Imports-to-South-Africa
Performing a detailed analysis of Fuel Imports to South Africa using data from South African Open Data

The purpose of this task was to analyse the fuel imports made by South Africa during the period 2010. This data was taken from the Open Data site.

The data contained values describing which region we import from (continent); which countries we import from; the price we pay for each import; 
the type of fuel that we import; the period when imports occured (Year/Month); the method of transport by which imports are delivered; 
and in which region of South Africa are imports being delivered to.

My objective for this project was to visually represent the different countries that South Africa Imports from and by what count. 
I then wanted to match the count to the the quantity of imports and find whether or not there is a correlation. 
I represented to which region in South Africa imports are delivered to by their total count and created a simple pie chart showing the method of transport of these imports. 
I created price bins for our data as the price range was too great to accurately and neatly display on any one graph. 
The price bins wre then represented by violin graphs containg box plots. This was then matched against the total quantity of imports to ascertain whether or not an increase in quantity per imports reflects an increase in price. 
I then used my price bins and matched them against the different fuel types to show how prices compare across the multiple fuel types we import.
